##### So, this is a prototype model of a OTT-Platform where people can enjoy their favourite digital content and at also pay for it. Before starting to work on it i gave a lot of time on the thinking process to decide and finalize the project concept because i wanted my projrct to be a lil-bit different from what others are doing and at the same time i wanted it to be eye-catchy so, i came up with this idea to make a OTT platform. For now i only have made the main(home) page of the site but still this is a full-fleged working and resposive web-site where one can play and watch the featured content in it, i didn't had any data(digital content) to showcase so i have embebbed my very own youtube videos for demonstration purposes. While making it's frontend i took a lot of inspiration form Netflix so this may feel a lil bit same. Although most of the buttons are working there are a few buttons that i haven't assigned to anything because i didn't had anything to link to it for e.g. The shows & movies section but even all those buttons can be used in future, even if those are not working i haven't kept those as only placeholders they are actual buttons so just by changing the ' href="#" ' to your desired destination will get the work done the make those buttons usuable. To make the web-site so much graphically awesome i had to use some custom css also, so other than the bootstrap css, navbars & etc. i also have saved the cstom one each one seperately inside the css folder with link to the licence from their respective copyright owners. The main structue and colorn scheme of my website is written on the index.html, main.js & style.css but to use some custom navbar from Bootstrap and to enable some particullar features i had to use some additional javascripts which are also seperatedly placed on the js folder. Other than that all the thumbnails and statics used by me on the wepage is available on the images folder. As i don't have any server for now, i am currently hosting it on the free servers provided by GitHub so some of the personalized features will not be woking but one can easily enable all the below mentioned features just by connecting a database server to it. So, that's all i had to say as a short breif of my project - FOURFLIX, I know thers still a lot of work remaining in it and for sure i will be spending a few more months in it to make all of it frontend and backend work done so that one make use of it but till then i hope you will like this small protoype of mine. Thank You.
