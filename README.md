# **FOURFLIX**
## An OTT platform

### **CITK Computer Science Diploma Final Year Project submersion by TEAM FANTASTIC-FOUR: SOUMIK DAS, TERESA BASUMATERY, MERINA BARO AND RAJ DEBNATH (Kokrajhar, INDIA)**

##### So, this is a prototype model of a OTT-Platform where people can enjoy their favorite digital content and at also pay for it. Before starting to work on it we gave a lot of time on the thinking process to decide and finalize the project concept because we wanted our project to be a lil-bit different from what others are doing and at the same time we wanted it to be eye-catchy so, we came up with this idea to make a OTT platform. For now we only have made the main(home) page of the site but still this is a full-fledged working and responsive web-site where one can play and watch the featured content in it, we didn't had any data(digital content) to showcase so we have embebbed our very own youtube videos for demonstration purposes. While making it's frontend we took a lot of inspiration form Netflix so this may feel a lil bit similar. Although most of the buttons are working there are a few buttons that we haven't assigned to anything because we didn't had anything to link to it for e.g. The shows & movies section but even all those buttons can be used in future, even if those are not working we haven't kept those as only placeholders they are actual buttons so just by changing the tag ' href="#" ' to your desired destination will get the work done and 
make those buttons usable. To make the web-site so much graphically awesome we had to use some custom css also, so other than the bootstrap css, navbars & etc. we also have saved the custom one each one separately inside the css folder with link to the license from their respective copyright owners. The main structure and color scheme of our website is written on the index.html, main.js & style.css but to use some custom navbar from Bootstrap and to enable some particular features we had to use some additional JavaScript which are also separately placed on the js folder. Other than that all the thumbnails and statics used by us on the webpage is available on the images folder. Aswedon't have any server for now,weam currently hosting it on the free servers provided by GitHub so some of the personalized features will not be working but one can easily enable all the below mentioned features just by connecting a database server to it. So, that's allwehad to say as a short brief of our project - FOURFLIX,weknow there's still a lot of work remaining in it and for surewewill be spending a few more months in it to make all of it frontend and backend work done so that one make use of it but till then we hope you will like this small prototype of mine. Thank You.
